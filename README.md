# MAINFRAME_London
Welcome to **MAINFRAME London**! We strive to gather the local AI community to help tackle global challenges in drug discovery in collaboration with the wider [MAINFRAME](https://web-app-153945772792.northamerica-northeast2.run.app/) community. We are part of the [Structure Genomics Consortium](https://www.thesgc.org/) and work in close collaboration with the [AIRCHECK](https://aircheck.ai/) initiative towards [Target 2035](https://www.target2035.net/).  

In the [Wiki](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/MAINFRAME_London/wiki) we have summarize what these initatives strive for and elaborated on our role in this framework.   

Please look at the [Issues](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/MAINFRAME_London/issues) section for the latest updates.
